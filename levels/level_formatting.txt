JSON file for level 1, formatting is as follows:

You can only view 26(.666) blocks across the x axis, and 15 across the y axis
at any one time.

i.e. That is the size of the game screen (1280x720 with blocks of size 42px)

The grid below is a representation of the map in the format of multiple arrays.
Each line (1,2,3...) represents a row on the screen with 1 being the top most row
and 15 being ground level.

Each of the rows holds an array, and within that array are the values for each individual
block. So the first block on row 1 will be 0 (air). This number then represents a certain type of
block, as described below.

?? You can also specify if a block is non-collidable by adding "N" after the block number
?? It is assumed that a block IS collidable unless otherwise specified.


If a row contains an empty array it will be assumed that the entire row is air.
